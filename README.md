# Augmented Bosses

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

*Icon is from AlgeButter on ArtStation*

Tweaks bosses to be more of a threat (Not all bosses are tweaked yet). 

Vagrant HP bars are always visible (after attacking once) so you can see when the coil is up. 

Bosses becomes frenzied (+Armor +AtkSpd +MoveSpd) at 50% HP and this state lasts for 10 seconds.

The instance of damage that would reduce HP below certain intervals (75%, 50%, 25%) is reduced by half making bosses more resistant to burst survivors.
