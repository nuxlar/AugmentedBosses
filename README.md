# Augmented Bosses

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

*Icon is from AlgeButter on ArtStation*

Tweaks bosses to be more of a threat (Not all bosses are tweaked yet). Enemy HP bars constantly show (so you can tell when Vagrant's tesla is up). Bosses becomes frenzied (+Armor +AtkSpd +MoveSpd) at 25% HP intervals (75%, 50%, 25%) and this state lasts for 10 seconds. Makes the bosses less of a 1-shot for more burst type survivors.
